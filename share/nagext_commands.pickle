VSchedules the next active check of a specified service at "check_time".  The "check_time" argument is specified in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX epoch).  Note that the service may not actually be checked at the time you specify.  This could occur for a number of reasons: active checks are disabled on a program-wide or service-specific basis, the service is already scheduled to be checked at an earlier time, etc.  If you want to force the service check to occur at the time you specify, look at the SCHEDULE_FORCED_SVC_CHECK command.

VCauses Nagios to load all current monitoring status information from the state retention file.  Normally, state retention information is loaded when the Nagios process starts up and before it starts monitoring.  WARNING: This command will cause Nagios to discard all current monitoring status information and use the information stored in state retention file!  Use with care.

VAllows you to send a custom service notification.  Very useful in dire situations, emergencies or to communicate with all admins that are responsible for a particular service.  When the service notification is sent out, the $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro will be set to "CUSTOM".  The <options> field is a logical OR of the following integer values that affect aspects of the notification that are sent out: 0 = No option (default), 1 = Broadcast (send notification to all normal and all escalated contacts for the service), 2 = Forced (notification is sent out regardless of current time, whether or not notifications are enabled, etc.), 4 = Increment current notification # for the service(this is not done by default for custom notifications).   The comment field can be used with the\u000a$NOTIFICATIONCOMMENT$ macro in notification commands.

Modified attributes values are used by Nagios to determine which object properties should be retained across program restarts.  Thus, modifying the value of the attributes can affect data retention.  This is an advanced option and should only be used by people who are intimately familiar with the data retention logic in Nagios.

This could occur for a number of reasons: active checks are disabled on a program-wide or service-specific basis, the host is already scheduled to be checked at an earlier time, etc.  If you want to force the host check to occur at the time you specify, look at the SCHEDULE_FORCED_HOST_CHECK command.
